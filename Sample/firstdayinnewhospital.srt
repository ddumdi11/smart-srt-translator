1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Pocket camera using the link in my bio.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:10,400
Price review, I share my kitchen with two other doctors and so four nights I paid 109 pounds.

3
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,540
We're having a repressed coffee outside our first day of induction.

4
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,180
Yes, vibes actually.

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,140
It feels like first day of school doesn't it?

6
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,220
It does, but last week I'm going to the village.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,200
He's going to where we were doing our first year basically.

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,960
Which we don't think.

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,440
The unnamed city.

10
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,700
Unnamed city?

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:46,860
Well, village.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,420
So I'm glad to be in the, what do you call it?

13
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,180
You know when a city is like a raw tag.

14
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,740
It's like...

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,540
I'm going to sell my...

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,540
Felicity is russum.

17
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,360
Like the fellow?

18
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,860
Yeah, developed by like they say, um, like, much of a cosmopolitan.

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,680
That's a bit of a politician.

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,280
Sounds like that.

21
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,080
It's like, um...

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,720
Down village?

23
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,900
I am back in the thing you say.

24
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,740
Oh, civilization!

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,220
Why did you...

26
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,340
I think it's the thing that's hitting the figure out.

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,420
It's the word.

28
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,740
For the first one minute.

29
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,440
Yeah, I feel like I'm back in civilization.

30
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,640
So I'm super happy with it.

31
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:29,740


32
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:30,740
It's nice.

33
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,980
It's nice views from the hospital.

34
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,980
We just had our ID cards.

35
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,280
You know how I'm doing?

36
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,020
I'll probably buy.

37
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,780
We're just having a break.

38
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,720
We're not doing anything today.

39
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,220
Until the first quarter.

40
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,540
Yeah, we're just going to have the induction.

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,280
Black Wednesday.

42
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,200
That's beautiful.

43
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,040
Wait, what's black Wednesday?

44
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,800
So every year, when there's new people rotating,

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,460
whether it's at once, if it's two IMTs, everyone,

46
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,280
it's called black Wednesday.

47
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,020
Because all the teams change across the whole country.

48
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,400
And it's the worst day for patients to get to the better.

49
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,300
Oh, yeah.

50
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,420
Because everything is busy.

51
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,440
There's no coordinates.

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,340
No one knows each other.

53
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,480
No one knows the...

54
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,040
I work on orthopedics.

55
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,360
I have no idea what the word is.

56
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,680
I don't even know the name of the word.

57
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,100
So, yeah, it is what they're doing.

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,300
Oh, okay. I think I'll try to do it.

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,920
Yeah, so black Wednesday.

60
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,600
It's quite sunny for a black Wednesday.

61
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,220
It is.

62
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,240
It's such a lovely day.

63
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,640
I'm doing okay.

64
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,300
Time-lapsey thing now.

65
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,300
She's a checker.

66
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,660
She's a lot.

67
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:30,960
She's a lot.

68
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,260
She's a checker.

69
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:31,760
She's a lot.

70
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,500
She's a lot.

71
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:33,780
She's a checker.

72
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:33,960
So much.

73
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,100


74
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,480
Let's go in.

75
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,260
I'm sorry.

76
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,480
I'm pretty stuck with that.

77
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,520
I'm a medication.

78
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,300
So we're good folks.

79
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,980
By the evening, we're good folks.

80
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,640
We just had some lunch.

81
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,640
Now we're chilling outside

82
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,760
whilst waiting for our induction to start.

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,720
It's the same user they bought last word you

84
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,660
had for Alec.

85
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,620
It's not even though it is.

86
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:02,840
Yay!

87
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,760
We're done for the day.

88
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,740
I had such a good day.

89
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,080
This was such a good day.

90
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,800
Honestly, I'm so happy.

91
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,000
Compared to what I experienced last year

92
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,720
on my first day as a doctor.

93
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,820
It's crazy how different I feel right now.

94
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,820
Obviously it's also because I'm

95
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,340
I did not really prefer the place

96
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,960
that I was working in last year.

97
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,440
And you know, everyone was a lot more.

98
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,280
Now that I actually feel closer to home

99
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,500
because this town is a lot closer to home for me.

100
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,660
And I met the team.

101
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,180
Everyone's so nice.

102
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't know.

103
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,920
It feels good.

104
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,960
Life is looking up.

105
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,560
I know it's crazy how there are more junior doctors than me

106
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,440
working on that ward.

107
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,860
I'm so used to being the most junior doctor.

108
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,440
Now that I'm not a baby doctor anymore

109
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,900
I have doctors that are more junior than me.

110
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,680
It feels like I'm very experienced, which I am.

111
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,000
Not very, but like I feel a lot more confident

112
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,920
compared to last year and more comfortable.

113
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,540
I'm a good doctor.

114
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,300
So yeah it's crazy how much I feel like I've grown.

115
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,340
I finished my week of working at this new hospital and came to the end of this

116
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,380
four-day rental in this accommodation because I was only staying here

117
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:03,440
temporarily whilst waiting for my new house to be ready and I just got the call.

118
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,800
What time we ate and to collect those keys tomorrow?

119
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,860
We're just around 1 o'clock?

120
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,040
Yes, exactly.

121
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,180
You don't get that 10 key room, it's 10 to cross, okay?

122
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,740
Okay, lovely. Thank you, bye.

123
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,940
So tomorrow I will be moving to my very first own place ever.

124
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,720
I never lived alone in my life, so I'm excited.

125
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,380
I feel like a proper adult, you know?

126
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:42,980
Please God, don't let me need a hospital accommodation state ever again in my life.

127
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,780
Obviously, never say never, you know?

128
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,300
If I need to, I will happily, not happily,

129
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,940
but I will be back.

130
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,660
I am hoping my life and hospital accommodation has come to an end now.

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,260
It's my sister's birthday celebration tomorrow.

132
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,500
If he feels good, that I don't need to miss my family and friends,

133
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,760
birthdays and special days anymore because I don't live too far anymore.

134
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,440
But that's the thing, like, as a doctor, especially during training.

135
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,160
You can go any part of the country, they can send you anywhere.

136
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,320
And if you want to continue training, you just have to stick it out.

137
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:46,280
Doctors don't have much location freedom and me realizing how important it is for me.

138
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,020
Made me reconsider my career choices.

139
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,440
No, yeah.
